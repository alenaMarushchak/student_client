Student Management system on React Redux 

## Description

Hi, this is a simple project to demonstrate my skills on **React** and **Redux**  . 
This is frontend-side project for Student Management System.

The main idea behind this project is the control of the learning process by students and faculty. Students can receive data from their subjects, teachers present ratings and view progress statistics.

Main requirements: 

The system should have three roles:
        
1.) **Administrator**
        
2.) **Teacher**
        
3.) **Student**

Basic system requirements:
    
1.) A **student** can:
       
- view group list;
        
- view grades for a particular subject;
        
- select posts categories.
   
 
    
2.) **Teacher** can:
        
- write a blog on your subjects;
        
- to place assessments and visits on their subjects;
        
- View student achievement in all subjects.
   
    

3.) The **administrator** can:

- to form groups of students;
        
- create (edit and delete) students and teachers;
        
- create (edit and delete) groups for students;
        
- delete posts;
        
- create (edit and delete) items.
